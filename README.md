# Hey, I'm Enver üëã  

AI Lead & Machine Learning Engineer with a PhD in ICT. I enjoy **turning chaos into systems that work** ‚Äî whether that‚Äôs training deep learning models, untangling microservices, or scaling infrastructure.  

Currently at [**Hekanize**](https://hekanize.com/), a SaaS CRM startup, where I joined early and helped shape the product and tech team.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Experience & Impact  

I build, lead, and optimize systems and teams. Highlights include:  

- Built & led a team of 8 developers + external suppliers while connecting tech, clients, and architects  
- Turned a messy microservice setup into a reliable, scalable SaaS product  
- Designed and deployed AI/ML modules for activity recognition, object detection, NLP, and more using PyTorch, TensorFlow, LangChain, and scikit-learn  
- Hands-on with C#, Java, Python, SQL, Docker, Terraform, AWS, and microservice debugging  
- Developed data pipelines, preprocessing workflows, and end-to-end ML solutions that work in production  

Basically: I build, lead, fix, optimize, and teach machines (and teams) to behave.

When I'm not debugging microservices or fine-tuning models, you‚Äôll likely find me **cycling** ‚Äî whether it‚Äôs a weekend endurance ride or a local competition. It keeps my mind sharp and my creativity flowing.
