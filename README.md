# Hey, I'm Enver üëã  

AI Lead & Machine Learning Engineer with a PhD in ICT. I enjoy **turning chaos into systems that work** ‚Äî whether that‚Äôs training deep learning models, fixing a microservice maze, or scaling infrastructure for enterprise clients.  

Currently at **Hekanize**, I was one of the first engineers on the ground when the product was (let‚Äôs say)‚Ä¶ *creatively* architected. Over time, I helped connect people, fix bottlenecks, and evolve the product into a SaaS CRM trusted by clients like **Prada, Dolce & Gabbana, Etro, and Campagnolo**.
